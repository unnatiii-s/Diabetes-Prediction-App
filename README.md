# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction App

This project is a **Streamlit web application** that predicts whether a patient is diabetic or not based on medical parameters. The prediction is made using a pre-trained deep learning model.  
Displays whether the person is **Diabetic** or **Not Diabetic**  
Uses a trained neural network (`.h5` model)
