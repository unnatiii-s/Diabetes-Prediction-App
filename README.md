Diabetes Prediction App<br>
This project is a Streamlit web application that predicts whether a patient is diabetic or not based on medical parameters. The prediction is made using a pre-trained deep learning model.
Displays whether the person is Diabetic or Not Diabetic<br>
Uses a trained neural network (.h5 model)<br>
